        <p class="quote">"Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole." Roger Caras</p>. <p> Anyone who has a dog will understand this sentiment, but life with dogs is not always easy, especially with the restrictions of modern society on dogs and their owners; the availability of poor - sometimes dangerous - training advice on the internet, in books and on TV; and just the simple misunderstandings that arise between two species that have opted to share their lives with each other for thousands of years.<br>
            I am  dedicated to improving the lives of domestic dogs as our companions in all sorts of roles; to providing training and behaviour advice that is based on scientifically proven methods, an understanding of the species, and the experience of successful trainers whose priority is building a healthy relationship with their dog.</p>

        <h3>Professional development</h3>
        <p>I am a Full Member of the Assocation of Pet Behaviour Counsellors (APBC) and The Canine Behaviour and Training Society (TCBTS) and Accredited Animal Behaviourist with the Animal Behaviour and Training Council.  Extensive professional development is undertaken annually including practical workshops, behavioural seminars and academic conferences. </p>
        <p> Recent behaviour seminars include Patricia MacConnell, Steve Lindsay, Ian Dunbar, Pia Silvani, Susan Friedman and Sarah Whitehead as well as those held annually by TCBTS (UKRCB), APBC and ClickerExpo.  </p>
        <p>Practical workshops on a range of topics include Tellington TTouch with Sarah Fisher, Scentwork with Talking Dogs, Heelwork to Music with Richard Curtis, Atilla Szkukalek and Annie Clayton, Obedience with Jo Hill and Clicker training with Kay Laurence, Helen Phillips and Lynda Edmondson at Wagmore Barns (Learning About Dogs).   </p>

    <div class="medium-6 columns">
        <p>Aggressive behaviour in dogs can be particularly distressing and difficult to understand, manage and change, so awareness and knowledge of different techniques and the best approach to use is particularly important.  Seminars and practical workshops on aggression undertaken include those by Brenda Aloff, Julie Bedford, Jim Crosby, Geert de Bolster, Anne McBride, Sue Sternberg, Kendal Shepherd, John Rogerson and Paddy Driscoll.</p>
        <p>Keeping up to date with latest scientific research on behaviour, welfare and learning in dogs is essential for any canine professional. The Canine Science Forum 5 day international conferences are where the latest scientific research findings on dog behaviour, training methods and human-dog relationships are presented biennially.  I have attended all five of the CSF conferences in Budapest (2008), Vienna (2010), Barcelona (2012), Lincoln (2014) and Padua, Italy (2016). </p>
